Wine Quality Prediction Project
This project focuses on building an effective machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties.
We use a supervised learning approach to classify wines as "good" or "bad."

Project Highlights
Model Engineering: An advanced Random Forest Classifier was engineered and optimized to solve the classification problem.

Data Preprocessing: The project addresses critical data challenges, including class imbalance using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) library and feature scaling with StandardScaler to ensure optimal model performance.

Performance Validation: The model's effectiveness was rigorously validated using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, achieving a final test accuracy of 91.9%. The model demonstrates a strong ability to distinguish between good and bad wines.

This project showcases skills in classification, advanced data preprocessing, model optimization, and evaluation, which are essential for any data science professional.
